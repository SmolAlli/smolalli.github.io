# Plugins

The input plugin that you want to use with RMG depends on the input type.

The emulator comes with 3 input plugins included, those being:

• raphnetraw (Mupen64Plus) for the Raphnet N64 adapter

• GC Adapter Plugin for Gamecube adapters in Wii U/Switch mode (Special instructions [here](#gc-plugin))

• Rosalie's Mupen GUI Input Plugin for XInput devices (e.g. Xbox, Playstation, Switch Pro Controller) and keyboards

For the last input plugin, it is not plug and play. To use it, connect/insert the preferred method of play, and then go to input settings (`ctrl` + `i` or settings → input). You should then select the device from the dropdown at the top, then map the buttons as preferred.

For any other device type that is not listed, you can _probably_ use a plugin designed for Mupen64Plus, however compatibility is not guaranteed.

## GC Plugin

For using a Gamecube controller, it is highly recommended to use the plugin bundled into RMG for it. However, to use it, there are a few steps.

• Set the adapter to be in Wii U/Switch mode.

• Download the <ExternalLink href="http://zadig.akeo.ie/">Zadig</ExternalLink> tool.

• Open and select **Options** -> **List All Devices**.

• **Important**:

1. Select "WUP-028" and and ensure the USB ID has a value of <br />`057E 0337`. If it does not, you should not continue.
