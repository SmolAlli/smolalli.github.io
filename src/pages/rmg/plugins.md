# Plugins

The input plugin that you want to use with RMG depends on the input type.

The emulator comes with 3 input plugins installed, those being:

• raphnetraw (Mupen64Plus) for the Raphnet N64 adapter

• GC Adapter for Gamecube adapters in Wii U/Switch mode

• Rosalie's Mupen GUI input plugin for XInput devices (e.g. Xbox, Playstation, Switch Pro Controller) and keyboards

Although I have not personally tested the raphnet plugin, I would assume it to be plug-and-play.

The GameCube plugin is plug-and-play.

For the other input plugin, it is not plug and play. To use it, connect/insert the preferred method of play, and then go to input settings (Ctrl + i or settings -> input). You should then select the device from the dropdown at the top, then map the buttons as preferred.

For any other device that is not listed, you can _probably_ use a plugin designed for Mupen64Plus, however compatibility is not guaranteed.
