<Details summary="No install path OR BetterDiscord not installed after using installer">
If you do not have a path to the Discord folder to install BetterDiscord into, or BetterDiscord did not show after installing, then press "browse" and paste <code> %localappdata%/discord/app-{whn}/resources</code> into the top bar.

If you do not know how to do that, look to the video below.

If BetterDiscord is still not on your Discord after installing, then use the path <code>%programdata%/%username%/Discord/app-{whn}/resources</code>.

If neither of these work, reinstall Discord and try again.

This is shown below:

<Details summary="Installer does not open">
If the installer seems to not want to open at all, then follow these instructions:

1\. Download and install <ExternalLink href="https://7-zip.org"> 7-zip</ExternalLink> (if you do not have it already)

2\. Create a new folder (can be anywhere)

3\. Right click on the BetterDiscord.exe file, and from the 7zip options, choose 'extract to...' and
choose the folder you just created

4\. Use the exe file in the folder you extracted to.

If this does not work, then try the <ExternalLink href="https://github.com/BetterDiscord/Installer/releases/download/v1.0.0-hotfix/BetterDiscord-Windows.exe">hotfix</ExternalLink>.

If none of these solutions solved your problem, then try <a href="/BetterDiscord/manual/windows">manually installing BetterDiscord</a>

<Details summary="Installer shows black instead of opening">
    If you get a black screen, try the following:

1\. Disable your AntiVirus.

2\. Press <kbd>âŠžWin</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> and paste <code>ipconfig /flushdns</code>

3\. If that doesn't work, try to restart your computer, or try the hotfix linked above.
