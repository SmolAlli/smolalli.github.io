If you are having issues with the regular installer, then try using <ExternalLink href="https://gist.github.com/ObserverOfTime/d7e60eb9aa7fe837545c8cb77cf31172">betterdiscordctl</ExternalLink> instead of the regular BD installer. If that does not work, you can instead try <a href="/BetterDiscord/manual">manually installing BetterDiscord</a>.
