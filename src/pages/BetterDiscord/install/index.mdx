Here is a guide on how to use the installer.

1\. Download the installer from the <ExternalLink href="https://betterdiscord.app">official website</ExternalLink> (and delete any old installers that you have)

2\. Open the installer. If it does not open, go to <a href="./install/issues">this link</a>.

3\. Click that you accept the license agreement, then "next". If you cannot do so, click specifically on the text next to the checkbox, as is shown below.

4\. Click "install", then "next".

5\. Click on the version that you wish to install BetterDiscord onto, then click "install". It should show a path to the "resources" folder for that install, but if it doesn't, go to <a href="./install/issues">this link</a>.

6\. It should install and say that is has successfully installed. If there is an error message, go to <a href="./install/errors">this link</a> and look for your specifc error.

7\. BetterDiscord should now be installed. You can check this by going to the settings part of Discord (<img src="https://i.imgur.com/H1XCRcO.png" alt="Cog icon" class="cog-img" />), with the new settings as shown below. If it is not, please follow <a href="./install/issues">this link</a>.
