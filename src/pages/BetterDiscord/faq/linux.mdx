<Details summary={'"How do I use React Devtools with a Flatpak installation of Discord?"'}>
Use the command `flatpak override --user --filesystem\=/home/$USER/.config/google-chrome/Default/Extensions/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi com.discordapp.Discord` in your terminal to allow for Flatpak to have access to the React Devtools extension.
\* Note: in the future when React Devtools supports other chromium sources to get the extension, this one will only work with Google Chrome's file location. I will not add where they are for other chromium browsers.
