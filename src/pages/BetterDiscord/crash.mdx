Guide for crashes on BetterDiscord.

These are all of the plugins (and other things) which are causing crashes. For the location of the plugins folder: <a href="faq">Click here.</a>

<Details summary={`"&#9888;&#65039; BetterDiscord seems to have crashed your client."`}>

You may have an outdated Library plugin. To fix this:

Download and replace <ExternalLink href="https://betterdiscord.app/Download?id=9">ZeresPluginLibrary</ExternalLink>

Download and replace <ExternalLink href="https://betterdiscord.app/Download?id=59">BDFDB</ExternalLink>.

It is recommended to replace both of those and in your plugins folder.

You may need to delete the files first before replacing them, if it does not work the first time.

This may also be caused by plugins not on the <ExternalLink href="https://betterdiscord.app/plugins">the BetterDiscord website</ExternalLink>. Please delete them IMMEDIATELY and do NOT reinstall them.

<Details summary={`"Well, this is awkward" or "You died, looks like you got slaughtered by an Error Level 9000"`}>
You most likely have an outdated version of BetterDiscord, or an outdated/broken plugin. Please make sure that
BetterDiscord is on the <ExternalLink href="https://github.com/BetterDiscord/BetterDiscord/releases/latest">latest version</ExternalLink>, and that your plugins are the most recent version.

If you wish to figure out which plugins are causing issues, you can either:

Take out all of the plugins from your plugins folder, then put them back in one at a time to see if they cause the issue.

Use the console tab from Devtools: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd> or on Mac: <kbd>âŒ˜Command</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd>, then go to the "Console" tab, click on "default levels" up the top and either look for the name of plugins, or you can go to the <ExternalLink href="https://betterdiscord.app/invite">Discord server</ExternalLink> and send the screenshot in the `#support` channel for someone to help you diagnose the issue.
